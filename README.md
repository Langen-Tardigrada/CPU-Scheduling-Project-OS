# data sets can random with random process. data sets save to text files at process folder.
# calculates waiting time and turn around time with algorithm (FCFS, SJF, RR). data sets of waiting and turn around time save to text files at data_of_time_folder then classifies with algorithm.
# render waiting time graph with 3 data sets(FCFS, SJF, RR) in one graph and classifies graph with amount of processes. render turn around time graph alike waiting time graph
